    "# Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concept\n",
    "Data Agents are LLM-powered knowledge workers in LlamaIndex that can intelligently perform various tasks over your data, in both a “read” and “write” function. They are capable of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Perform automated search and retrieval over different types of data - unstructured, semi-structured, and structured.\n",
    "* Calling any external service API in a structured fashion, and processing the response + storing it for later.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that sense, agents are a step beyond our [query engines](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/deploying/query_engine/) in that they can not only \"read\" from a static source of data, but can dynamically ingest and modify data from a variety of different tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building a data agent requires the following core components:\n",
    "* A reasoning loop\n",
    "* Tool abstractions\n",
    "\n",
    "A data agent is initialized with set of APIs, or Tools, to interact with; these APIs can be called by the agent to return information or modify state. Given an input task, the data agent uses a reasoning loop to decide which tools to use, in which sequence, and the parameters to call each tool."

    "### Reasoning Loop\n",
    "The reasoning loop depends on the type of agent. We have support for the following agents:\n",

    "* ReAct agent (works across any chat/text completion endpoint).\n",
